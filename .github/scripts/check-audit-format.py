"""The audit log format version: compute it, write it, and check it is right.

`AUDIT_FORMAT` is not edited by hand and does not move once per pull request. It is derived
from committed state:

    AUDIT_FORMAT = audit-format/released.json  raised once by  the highest level
                                                               in audit-format/unreleased/

So a release raises the version at most once however many changes it carries, and a major
change absorbs every minor change in the same cycle. Being a pure function also makes it
idempotent: withdrawing a fragment lowers the answer again rather than leaving the version
over-claimed.

What each pull request owes is a FRAGMENT, not a version number: one file declaring the
level of its change and describing it in the terms an operator parsing the log thinks in.
The fixture tests classify a format change, but only until someone regenerates the fixtures
— after `just update-audit-fixtures` they pass whether a fragment was written or not.
Relating the two is what this does, and it needs both the old and the new state, so it lives
in CI rather than in a Rust test.
