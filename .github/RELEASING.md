# Releasing — runbook

## The three files

| File | What | Who maintains |
|------|------|----------------|
| `CHANGELOG.md` | release-please index: PR-title **headlines** + PR links + SHAs. Headlines only — never hand-edited. | release-please (auto) |
| `site/docs/about/release-notes.md` | Curated, **customer-facing** release notes — the published "Release Notes" page on the docs site. | summarised at release from PR descriptions |
| `audit-format/` | The audit log format version: `released.json` (what the last release shipped) and `unreleased/*.md` (one fragment per change since). | `just audit-format-release` at release |
| `.github/RELEASING.md` | This runbook. | maintainers |

`CHANGELOG.md` is the *index* used to find a release's PRs; the customer-facing prose
on the site page is **summarised from each PR's description** — not from the changelog
titles.

## Per-PR (during development)

Write a clear PR description of the user-visible change and its benefit (not the
implementation). That's the only ask — no special block, no label.

Optionally add a dedicated **`## Release notes`** section in the PR description to fix
the exact customer-facing wording for a subtle or high-impact change.

## At release

release-please maintains `CHANGELOG.md` and, on a merged release PR, cuts a **draft**
GitHub Release + tag (`vX.Y.Z`).

```bash
VERSION=0.12.3        # the release just cut, without the leading v
TAG="v$VERSION"
NOTES=site/docs/about/release-notes.md
```

1. **List the PRs in this release** from the new `CHANGELOG.md` section:

   ```bash
   awk -v v="$VERSION" '
     $0 ~ "^## \\[" v "\\]" {f=1; next}
     f && /^## \[/ {exit}
     f' CHANGELOG.md | grep -oE '#[0-9]+' | tr -d '#' | sort -un
   ```

2. **Read each PR's description and summarise it** (agent-assisted is fine; use a PR's
   `## Release notes` section verbatim when it has one):

   ```bash
   gh pr view <N> --repo lakekeeper/lakekeeper --json title,body
   ```

3. **Add the `## $TAG (date)` section** at the top of `$NOTES` (newest first): group into
   Highlights / Features / Bug Fixes / Breaking Changes / Upgrade Notes; one line per
   item; link the PRs as `[#NNNN](https://github.com/lakekeeper/lakekeeper/pull/NNNN)`.
4. **Fold in the audit log format changes.** `AUDIT_FORMAT` is derived, so nothing needs
   bumping here — but the fragments written since the last release have to reach the notes
   before they are cleared. In this order:

   ```bash
   just audit-format-release-notes          # prints the block
   #                                        # paste it into this release's section of $NOTES
   just audit-format-release "$VERSION"     # moves the baseline, deletes the fragments
   ```

   The paste is not optional and the order is not a convention: the second command refuses
   to run until every fragment's text appears in the `## v$VERSION` section of `$NOTES`,
   and changes nothing when it refuses. A fragment's prose exists nowhere else, so clearing
   it first would leave the version as the only record that anything changed — and a
   version does not say what moved.

   The second command also prints a row for the release table in `docs/docs/logging.md`
   when the format moved. Add it.

   Forgetting the step is **not** reliably self-detecting. Nothing reads a git tag or the
   `released_in` field back, so a stale baseline is only noticed when the next cycle's
   highest fragment level exceeds the forgotten one's — pull requests onto `main` stay green
   otherwise. The first pull request targeting a `rel-*` branch does fail, because the freeze
   compares the declared version against the baseline. Treat the step as unchecked.

5. **Commit `$NOTES` to `main` together with everything step 4 changed** — the moved
   baseline in `audit-format/released.json`, the deleted `audit-format/unreleased/*.md`
   fragments, and the release-table row in `docs/docs/logging.md`. Leaving any of them
   uncommitted is the omission step 4 warns is not reliably self-detecting. (A normal
   commit; the site redeploys from it.) Do **not**
   edit it inside the release-please PR — release-please force-regenerates that branch on
   every push to `main` and would clobber the change.
6. **Set the GitHub Release body** from the new section:

   ```bash
   gh release edit "$TAG" --repo lakekeeper/lakekeeper \
     --notes-file <(awk -v t="## $TAG" 'index($0,t)==1{f=1;next} f&&/^## /{exit} f' "$NOTES")
   ```

## House style

Keep entries customer-facing and short — **one line per change, benefit first**. Inline
only the single most important setting (flag / env var); link everything else to the
docs. Add `### Highlights` only when 2-3 changes genuinely stand out. Omit empty
sections. Link the (public) PRs as Markdown links. Credit external contributors with
`(thanks @handle)`.

Sections, in order: **Highlights · Features · Bug Fixes · Breaking Changes · Upgrade
Notes**. The assembled audit log block goes under **Upgrade Notes**, or under **Breaking
Changes** when it carries a major change.

Patch releases cut from `rel-*` never change the audit log format — CI rejects a change to
it on those branches — so a patch's notes never carry an audit log block.

## What to leave out / collapse

The `CHANGELOG.md` PR list is raw input, not the release notes. Curate it:

- **Don't list a bug fix for code first introduced in the same release.** If the feature
  and its follow-up fix both land in this version, the bug never shipped — fold the fix
  into the feature (or drop it). Check with `git show <last-release-tag>:<path>`: if the
  fixed code/route didn't exist at the previous release, it's a same-release fix. (A fix
  for a path that *did* exist at the last release is a real, listable fix.)
- **One line per feature, even when it spanned several PRs.** Backend + management API +
  console PRs for the same capability are a single entry citing all the PRs together.
- **Highlight what matters to OSS users.** The OSS authorizer is OpenFGA; changes that
  only affect the built-in/internal authorization store are not OSS highlights (OpenFGA
  already covers most of that ground) — keep them to a modest Features line or omit.
- **Don't re-announce features that shipped in a parallel `rel-*` patch.** Patch releases
  are cut from `rel-*` branches, so `main`'s release-please CHANGELOG re-lists those PRs
  under the next minor (it diffs `last-main-release...this`). Put them in the patch's own
  notes section and omit them here. Add the patch section too if it was never written up.

## Notes

- No CI generation, no API key, no `git-cliff`. Summarising is a manual/agent-assisted
  pass at release; clear PR descriptions are what make it easy.
- The page is published on the docs site and its sections are reused by Lakekeeper
  Enterprise's upstream-changes rollup — keep them customer-facing and accurate.
- If this becomes a bottleneck (much higher PR volume, or notes get skipped), graduate
  to changelog fragments (`changie`/towncrier or a homegrown assemble step).
