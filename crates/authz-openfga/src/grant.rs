//! The grant facet: `/grants` served from the same tuples the
//! `/permissions/…/assignments` API writes.
//!
//! There is no second store and no migration. A grant is an assignment tuple
//! `(principal, privilege-relation, object)`, so the two APIs are two views of one
//! set of tuples, which is what lets `/grants` become the universal surface without
//! stranding anything written through the older one.
//!
//! Three mappings carry the whole facet, all derived from the per-level `API*Relation`
//! enums rather than restated here:
//!
//! * **vocabulary** — the enum's variants are exactly the assignable privileges;
//! * **assignment relation** — `ReducedRelation::to_openfga`, the relation a grant writes;
//! * **authority relation** — the relation a caller must hold to move it:
//!   `GrantableRelation::grant_relation` to hand it out,
//!   `RevocableRelation::revoke_relation` to take it back.
//!
//! Adding an assignable relation to the model therefore extends `/grants` with no
//! change here.
