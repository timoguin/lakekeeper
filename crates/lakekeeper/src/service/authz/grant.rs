//! Grants: direct `principal -> privilege -> resource` permissions.
//!
//! A grant is the enumerable, click-driven counterpart to expression-based policy.
//! Two things about it are owned by the authorizer, not by this layer:
//!
//! * **Storage.** [`Authorizer::grants`](super::Authorizer::grants) returns `Some`
//!   when the authorizer keeps grant edges in its own store, and `None` when the
//!   catalog's `grant_assignment` table is authoritative — the same split as
//!   [`ManagesRoleAssignments`](super::ManagesRoleAssignments).
//! * **Vocabulary.** Each authorizer publishes its own closed set of grantable
//!   privileges per resource type. The catalog stores the privilege *by name* and
//!   never interprets it, which is what lets the API be uniform while the
//!   privilege sets differ.
//!
//! A grant's identity is the `(principal, privilege, resource)` triple. There is no
//! grant id: an authorizer-managed store cannot mint one, and revocation is
//! expressed as a diff of triples, so nothing needs one.
//!
//! Grants do **not** inherit. A grant held by a role is the role's grant, and a
//! grant on a parent resource is a grant on the parent. Resolving what a principal
//! may *effectively* do is a separate question answered by the action-check API.
