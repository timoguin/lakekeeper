# Running Lakekeeper in Production

Lakekeeper is the heart of your data platform. The open-source catalog is built to run in production — it holds no local state, scales horizontally behind a load balancer, and upgrades stay online while database migrations run.

Enterprise and regulated production demands more than uptime: governed and provable access control, audited identity, and maintenance run for you. That is what **Lakekeeper+** <span class="lkp"></span> delivers — the production-grade path for the enterprise, backed by [Vakamo](https://vakamo.com). For these environments, Lakekeeper+ is what you need.

## Production checklist (open source)

Everything you need to run Lakekeeper OSS safely is covered in the docs. In short:

- **High-availability Postgres** as the catalog backend, with separate read/write URLs and regular, tested backups.
- **Authentication** enabled through your existing OpenID provider (or Kubernetes auth).
- **Authorization** configured for your access model.
- **Horizontal scaling** with multiple instances — use the [Helm chart](https://github.com/lakekeeper/lakekeeper-charts/tree/main/charts/lakekeeper), which ships readiness/liveness probes and autoscaling.
- **TLS termination** at a reverse proxy or ingress — Lakekeeper does not terminate connections itself.
- **Monitoring & observability** wired to your stack.

See the full [Production Checklist](./docs/nightly/docs/production.md) for the complete, up-to-date list.

## Lakekeeper+: the production-grade path <span class="lkp"></span>

Lakekeeper+ builds on the open-source catalog with the capabilities regulated and large-scale platforms need, developed and supported by the team behind Lakekeeper.

- :material-file-lock: &nbsp; __Permission-as-code with Cedar__

    ---

    Express access policy as versioned, reviewable [Cedar](./docs/nightly/docs/authorization-cedar.md) policies — RBAC, ABAC, and property-based access in one model. Every decision is inspectable, with a per-decision policy trace and audit log, so you can prove *why* access was granted. Built for **regulated industries** where access must be governed, testable, and provable.

- :material-robot: &nbsp; __Autonomous maintenance__

    ---

    Keep query performance high and storage costs low without operating maintenance jobs yourself. [Table maintenance](./docs/nightly/docs/table-maintenance.md) — expiring snapshots and removing orphan files — runs automatically and adaptively, scheduling itself per table based on how fast reclaimable data builds up.

- :material-account-key: &nbsp; __Enterprise identity & governance__

    ---

    Resolve roles through [role providers](./docs/nightly/docs/configuration.md#role-provider) — Okta, Microsoft Entra ID, and LDAP; gate access with an external admission check; protect provider-synced roles from drift. Structured audit logs make the catalog auditable end to end.

    Commercial support from [Vakamo](https://vakamo.com){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} for self-hosted and managed deployments, plus hardened Long-Term Support release lines — so you can run Lakekeeper at the heart of your platform with confidence.
