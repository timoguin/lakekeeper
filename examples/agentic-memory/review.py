"""Skill triage for the governance agent.

The reviewer's problem is volume, not judgement: forty proposals arrive overnight and one
of them matters. This ranks them so a human reads the right three.

**The verdicts are deterministic. The model only writes prose.** That split is the whole
design. A governance agent is, by construction, a thing that reads attacker-controlled
text — a proposed skill is exactly that — so if the model also decided the outcome, a
skill could talk its way through by addressing the reviewer instead of the task. Rules
cannot be argued with, replay identically tomorrow, and can be shown to an auditor.

The model's one job is a readable one-line summary, clearly labelled advisory. Nothing it
writes changes a severity.

And the governance agent cannot act on any of this: it holds `select` on the proposal
queues and nothing on `skills.approved`. It sorts the inbox; a person still signs.

**The rules themselves are governed data, not code.** They live in a `dataset` table at
`governance.policy` as `triage-rules.json`, because the real privilege in this system is
not approving a skill — it is deciding what counts as suspicious. Anyone who can weaken a
rule makes the triage theatre, silently and with no diff to review. So the governance
agent holds `select` on that table and nothing more: it reads the rules it enforces and
cannot change them. Editing them is a security-admin act, versioned and audited like any
other write, which also answers "which rule set was in force when this was approved?"

They are a *policy*, deliberately not a skill. A skill is instructions a model reads and
follows; a policy is rules an engine executes. Storing these as a `SKILL.md` would invite
someone to have the model interpret them, which is precisely the manipulability the
deterministic split exists to avoid.
