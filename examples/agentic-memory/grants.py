"""Granting helpers: namespaces, generic tables, and why the difference matters.

Kept out of `mlib.py` because this is the file worth reading — the grants below are the
whole demonstration, and every line of it is one decision about who may see what.

This uses the **permissions** API, not the newer authorizer-independent Grants API: the
latter is preview and is not in the released server this example runs against (0.13.x).
The shapes differ — assignments take `{"type": <privilege>, "user": <id>}` — and the
generic-table path is nested under the warehouse while the namespace path is not.

A note on levels. In the OpenFGA model a namespace grant flows downward
(`define select: ... or select from parent`), so `select` on the `skills` namespace would
also expose every agent's proposal queue underneath it. Skills are therefore granted on
the **table**, memory on the **namespace** — the first because the boundary runs between
siblings, the second because it runs around a whole scope.

And one asymmetry that constrains the design: `can_read_data` resolves through
`select_effective`, which includes `modify_effective` — so **read can be granted without
write, but write cannot be granted without read**. There is no write-only grant. That is
why each agent files proposals into its own table rather than a shared queue: a shared one
would be readable by everyone who could write to it.

(The model splits *granted* from *effective* privileges — assignments name the bare
relation, `select`, while checks resolve `select_effective`. The implication above lives on
the effective side, so the behaviour is the same as before the split.)
