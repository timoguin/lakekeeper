# # 03 · The governance agent
#
# The reviewer's problem is not judgement, it is volume: forty proposals arrive overnight
# and one of them matters. A governance agent reads every queue and ranks them so peter
# reads the right three.
#
# Two things make it safe to point an agent at this job:
#
# **The verdicts are deterministic; the model only writes prose.** A governance agent is by
# construction a thing that reads attacker-controlled text — a proposed skill is exactly
# that. If the model also decided the outcome, a skill could talk its way through by
# addressing the reviewer instead of the task. Rules cannot be argued with.
#
# **It reads everything and writes nothing.** It cannot approve, and it cannot weaken the
# rules it enforces. Both are refused by the catalog, not by its code.

# rather the point of pointing it at the queues rather than at a list.)

# ### The queue, with a decision on each
#
# Every button below is a real catalog write under peter's identity. The same clicks made
# by an agent's client would fail at the vend — try it by passing `gov` instead of
# `peter_client` and watch each one come back `AccessDenied`.
#
# Two pieces of friction are deliberate, and they are the same idea at two scales:
#
# * **A critical proposal cannot be approved until it has been opened.** Rules cannot
#   separate malicious intent from clumsy phrasing, so the most they can honestly do is
#   force a person to look. Approving anyway stays possible — after reading.
# * **Bulk approval covers ok and warning, never critical.** Clearing five proposals that
#   nothing fired on should be one click. Accepting flagged ones is a different act, so it
#   takes two. And no button exists that could sweep a critical finding through, because
#   that would quietly undo the rule above.

#
# **What the governance agent changed:** the order peter reads in. Nothing else. It holds no
# credential that lets it approve a skill or alter what counts as suspicious, and every read
# it made is in the audit log under its own identity.
#
# **Where this stops.** Deterministic rules catch phrasing, not intent — a carefully worded
# malicious procedure passes every regex here. Triage buys attention, not safety. If you
# want auto-promotion at volume, the honest path is a policy principal applying an approval
# tag under stated conditions, never a model's judgement about text it was handed.

# %% [markdown]
# ### The decision log
#
# `skills.decisions` is an **Iceberg** table, and it is the one place in this example where
# Iceberg earns its keep. The reasons that ruled it out for agent memory do not apply:
# decisions are central rather than per-scope, so there is a single table to query; the
# readers are auditors writing SQL, not agents doing recall; and it is append-only,
# multi-writer and time-ordered, which is Iceberg's actual job — and precisely what generic
# tables do not offer, since the catalog does not arbitrate their commits.
#
# Note `rules_version`. It pins which rule set was in force when the call was made, so a
# later review can separate *"we did not check for that then"* from *"we checked and missed
# it"* — a distinction that matters in a post-mortem.

# %%
log = decisions.history(catalog, NS_SKILLS)
print(decisions.summary(log))

# %% [markdown]
# Because it is a normal Iceberg table, the audit question is a normal query — from here,
# or from Trino, Spark or DuckDB pointed at the same catalog, under the same grants.
