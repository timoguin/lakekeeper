# Authorization

## Overview

Authentication verifies *who* you are, while authorization determines *what* you can do.

Authorization can only be enabled if Authentication is enabled. Please check the [Authentication Docs](./authentication.md) for more information.

Lakekeeper currently supports the following Authorizers:

* **AllowAll**: A simple authorizer that allows all requests. This is mainly intended for development and testing purposes.
* **OpenFGA**: A fine-grained authorization system based on the CNCF project [OpenFGA](https://openfga.dev). Please find more information in the [Authorization with OpenFGA](#authorization-with-openfga) section. OpenFGA requires an additional OpenFGA service to be deployed (this is included in our self-contained examples and our helm charts).
* **Cedar**<span class="lkp"></span>: An enterprise-grade policy-based authorization system based on [Cedar](https://cedarpolicy.com). The cedar authorizer is built into Lakekeeper and requires no additional external services. Please find more information in the [Authorization with Cedar](#authorization-with-cedar) section.
* **Custom**: Lakekeeper supports custom authorizers via the `Authorizer` trait.

## Authorization with OpenFGA

Lakekeeper can use [OpenFGA](https://openfga.dev) to store and evaluate permissions. OpenFGA provides bi-directional inheritance, which is key for managing hierarchical namespaces in modern lakehouses. For query engines like Trino, Lakekeeper's OPA bridge translates OpenFGA permissions into Open Policy Agent (OPA) format. See the [OPA Bridge Guide](./opa.md) for details.

Check the [Authorization Configuration](./configuration.md#authorization) for setup details.

### Grants
The default permission model is focused on collaborating on data. Permissions are additive. The underlying OpenFGA model is defined in [`schema.fga` on GitHub](https://github.com/lakekeeper/lakekeeper/blob/main/authz/openfga/). The following grants are available:

| Entity    | Grant                                                            |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| server    | admin, operator                                                  |
| project   | project_admin, security_admin, data_admin, role_creator, describe, select, create, modify |
| warehouse | ownership, pass_grants, manage_grants, describe, select, create, modify |
| namespace | ownership, pass_grants, manage_grants, describe, select, create, modify |
| table     | ownership, pass_grants, manage_grants, describe, select, modify  |
| view      | ownership, pass_grants, manage_grants, describe, modify          |
| role      | assignee, ownership                                              |


##### Ownership
Owners of objects have all rights on the specific object. When principals create new objects, they automatically become owners of these objects. This enables powerful self-service szenarios where users can act autonomously in a (sub-)namespace. By default, Owners of objects are also able to access grants on objects, which enables them to expand the access to their owned objects to new users. Enabling [Managed Access](#managed-access) for a Warehouse or Namespace removes the `grant` privilege from owners.

##### Server: Admin
A `server`'s `admin` role is the most powerful role (apart from `operator`) on the server. In order to guarantee auditability, this role can list and administrate all Projects, but does not have access to data in projects. While the `admin` can assign himself the `project_admin` role for a project, this assignment is tracked by `OpenFGA` for audits. `admin`s can also manage all projects (but no entities within it), server settings and users.

##### Server: Operator
The `operator` has unrestricted access to all objects in Lakekeeper. It is designed to be used by technical users (e.g., a Kubernetes Operator) managing the Lakekeeper deployment.

##### Project: Security Admin
A `security_admin` in a project can manage all security-related aspects, including grants and ownership for the project and all objects within it. However, they cannot modify or access the content of any object, except for listing and browsing purposes.

##### Project: Data Admin
A `data_admin` in a project can manage all data-related aspects, including creating, modifying, and deleting objects within the project. They can delegate the `data_admin` role they already hold (for example to team members), but they do not have general grant or ownership administration capabilities.

##### Project: Admin
A `project_admin` in a project has the combined responsibilities of both `security_admin` and `data_admin`. They can manage all security-related aspects, including grants and ownership, as well as all data-related aspects, including creating, modifying, and deleting objects within the project.

##### Project: Role Creator
A `role_creator` in a project can create new roles within it. This role is essential for delegating the creation of roles without granting broader administrative privileges.

##### Describe
The `describe` grant allows a user to view metadata and details about an object without modifying it. This includes listing objects and viewing their properties. The `describe` grant is inherited down the object hierarchy, meaning if a user has the `describe` grant on a higher-level entity, they can also describe all child entities within it. The `describe` grant is implicitly included with the `select`, `create`, and `modify` grants.

##### Select
The `select` grant allows a user to read data from an object, such as tables or views. This includes querying and retrieving data. The `select` grant is inherited down the object hierarchy, meaning if a user has the `select` grant on a higher-level entity, they can select all views and tables within it. The `select` grant implicitly includes the `describe` grant.

##### Create
The `create` grant allows a user to create new objects within an entity, such as tables, views, or namespaces. The `create` grant is inherited down the object hierarchy, meaning if a user has the `create` grant on a higher-level entity, they can also create objects within all child entities. The `create` grant implicitly includes the `describe` grant.

##### Modify
The `modify` grant allows a user to change the content or properties of an object, such as updating data in tables or altering views. The `modify` grant is inherited down the object hierarchy, meaning if a user has the `modify` grant on a higher-level entity, they can also modify all child entities within it. The `modify` grant implicitly includes the `select` and `describe` grants.

##### Pass Grants
The `pass_grants` grant allows a user to pass their own privileges to other users. This means that if a user has certain permissions on an object, they can grant those same permissions to others. However, the `pass_grants` grant does not include the ability to pass the `pass_grants` privilege itself.

##### Manage Grants
The `manage_grants` grant allows a user to manage all grants on an object, including creating, modifying, and revoking grants. This also includes `manage_grants` and `pass_grants`.

### Inheritance

* **Top-Down-Inheritance**: Permissions in higher up entities are inherited to their children. For example if the `modify` privilege is granted on a `warehouse` for a principal, this principal is also able to `modify` any namespaces, including nesting ones, tables and views within it.
* **Bottom-Up-Inheritance**: Permissions on lower entities, for example tables, inherit basic navigational privileges to all higher layer principals. For example, if a user is granted the `select` privilege on table `ns1.ns2.table_1`, that user is implicitly granted limited list privileges on `ns1` and `ns2`. Only items in the direct path are presented to users. If `ns1.ns3` would exist as well, a list on `ns1` would only show `ns1.ns2`.

### Managed Access
Managed access is a feature designed to provide stricter control over access privileges within Lakekeeper. It is particularly useful for organizations that require a more restrictive access control model to ensure data security and compliance.

In some cases, the default ownership model, which grants all privileges to the creator of an object, can be too permissive. This can lead to situations where non-admin users unintentionally share data with unauthorized users by granting privileges outside the scope defined by administrators. Managed access addresses this concern by removing the `grant` privilege from owners and centralizing the management of access privileges.

With managed access, admin-like users can define access privileges on high-level container objects, such as warehouses or namespaces, and ensure that all child objects inherit these privileges. This approach prevents non-admin users from granting privileges that are not authorized by administrators, thereby reducing the risk of unintentional data sharing and enhancing overall security.

Managed access combines elements of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Discretionary Access Control (DAC). While RBAC allows privileges to be assigned to roles and users, DAC assigns ownership to the creator of an object. By integrating managed access, Lakekeeper provides a balanced access control model that supports both self-service analytics and data democratization while maintaining strict security controls.

Managed access can be enabled or disabled for warehouses and namespaces using the UI or the `../managed-access` Endpoints. Managed access settings are inherited down the object hierarchy, meaning if managed access is enabled on a higher-level entity, it applies to all child entities within it.

### Best Practices
We recommend separating access to data from the ability to grant privileges. To achieve this, the `security_admin` and `data_admin` roles divide the responsibilities of the initial `project_admin`, who has the authority to perform tasks in both areas.

### OpenFGA in Production
When deploying OpenFGA in production environments, ensure you follow the [OpenFGA Production Checklist](https://openfga.dev/docs/best-practices/running-in-production).

Lakekeeper includes [Query Consistency](https://openfga.dev/docs/interacting/consistency) specifications with each authorization request to OpenFGA. For most operations, `MINIMIZE_LATENCY` consistency provides optimal performance while maintaining sufficient data consistency guarantees.

For medium to large-scale deployments, we strongly recommend enabling caching in OpenFGA and increasing the database connection pool limits. These optimizations significantly reduce database load and improve authorization latency. Configure the following environment variables in OpenFGA (written for version 1.10). You may increase the number of connections further if your database deployment can handle additional connections:

```sh
OPENFGA_DATASTORE_MAX_OPEN_CONNS=200
OPENFGA_DATASTORE_MAX_IDLE_CONNS=100
OPENFGA_CACHE_CONTROLLER_ENABLED=true
OPENFGA_CHECK_QUERY_CACHE_ENABLED=true
OPENFGA_CHECK_ITERATOR_CACHE_ENABLED=true
```

## Authorization with Cedar <span class="lkp"></span> {#authorization-with-cedar}

Cedar is an enterprise-grade, policy-based authorization system built into Lakekeeper that requires no external services. Cedar uses a declarative policy language to define access controls, making it ideal for organizations that prefer infrastructure-as-code approaches to authorization management.

Check the [Authorization Configuration](./configuration.md#authorization) for setup details.

### Schema and Entity Model

For each authorization request, Lakekeeper provides the complete entity hierarchy from the requested resource up to the server level. This ensures policies have full context for making authorization decisions.

When a user queries table `ns1.ns2.table1` in warehouse `wh-1` within project `my-project`, Cedar receives the following entities:

- `Server` (root)
- `Project::"my-project"`
- `Warehouse::"wh-1"` (parent: `my-project`)
- `Namespace::"ns1"` (parent: `wh-1`)
- `Namespace::"ns2"` (parent: `ns1`)
- `Table::"table1"` (parent: `ns2`)

This hierarchical context allows policies to reference any level in the path. For example, you can write policies that grant access based on the warehouse name, namespace hierarchy, or specific table properties.

The Lakekeeper Cedar schema defines all available entity types, attributes, and actions. All loaded entities and policies are validated against this schema on startup and refresh. You can download the schema here: [lakekeeper.cedarschema](api/lakekeeper.cedarschema) or find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/lakekeeper/lakekeeper/tree/main/docs/docs/api).

**Important**: Lakekeeper does not provide Roles as built-in entities. Roles must be defined as custom entities in your entity JSON files.

### Policy Examples

Grant admin access to a specific user:
```cedar
permit (
    principal == Lakekeeper::User::"oidc~<sub-field-from-user-token>",
    action,
    resource
);
```

Role-based warehouse access:
```cedar
// Grant full access to all entities in a warehouse with name "wh-1"
permit (
    principal in Lakekeeper::Role::"warehouse-1-admins",
    action in [Lakekeeper::Action::"NamespaceActions",
               Lakekeeper::Action::"TableActions",
               Lakekeeper::Action::"ViewActions"],
    resource
)
when { resource.warehouse.name == "wh-1" };

// Allow modification of the warehouse itself
permit (
    principal in Lakekeeper::Role::"warehouse-1-admins",
    action in [Lakekeeper::Action::"WarehouseModifyActions"],
    resource
)
when { resource.name == "wh-1" };
```

Table read access for all tables in the `analytics` namespace of warehouse `wh-1`:
```cedar
permit (
    principal == Lakekeeper::User::"oidc~<sub-field-from-user-token>",
    action in [Lakekeeper::Action::"TableSelectActions"],
    resource
)
when {
    resource.namespace.name == "analytics" &&
    resource.warehouse.name == "wh-1"
};
```

### Entity Definition Example

Define roles and assign users to them using JSON entity files:

```json
[
    {
        "uid": {
            "type": "Lakekeeper::User",
            "id": "oidc~90471f73-e338-4032-9a6b-1e021cc3cb1e"
        },
        "attrs": {
            "display_name": "machine-user-1"
        },
        "parents": [
            {
                "type": "Lakekeeper::Role",
                "id": "data-engineering"
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "uid": {
            "type": "Lakekeeper::Role",
            "id": "data-engineering"
        },
        "attrs": {
            "name": "DataEngineering",
            "project": {
                "__entity": {
                    "type": "Lakekeeper::Project",
                    "id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
                }
            }
        },
        "parents": [
            {
                "type": "Lakekeeper::Role",
                "id": "warehouse-1-admins"
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

### Policy and Entity Management

**Startup Behavior:**

- All policy and entity files are loaded and validated against the Cedar schema
- If any file is unreadable or invalid, Lakekeeper fails to start with an error

This ensures that authorization policies are always valid before serving requests

**Refresh Behavior:**
Configure automatic policy refresh using `LAKEKEEPER__CEDAR__REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECS` (default: 5 seconds):

1. **Change Detection**: Lightweight checks monitor ConfigMap versions and file timestamps
2. **Reload on Change**: Modified entity or policy files trigger a full reload of all files to guarantee consistency
3. **Atomic Updates**: The in-memory store is only updated if all files reload successfully
4. **Error Handling**: If any reload fails, the previous configuration is retained, an error is logged, and health checks report unhealthy status

This approach ensures that authorization policies remain consistent and that partial updates never compromise security.
