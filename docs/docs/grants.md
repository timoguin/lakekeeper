# Grants API

A grant gives one **principal** (a user or a role) one named **privilege** on one **resource**: *Alice may `select` on this warehouse*. You hand them out, list them, and take them back, one at a time. See [Authorization](./authorization.md#grants-privileges-and-roles) for how grants relate to your authorizer's model.

!!! warning "Preview"
    This API is in preview and may change in a backward-incompatible way in a future release.

## One API, every authorizer

This is the authorizer-independent way to manage permissions: the same endpoints and the same request shape whichever [authorizer](./authorization.md#choose-an-authorizer) you run. What differs is what your authorizer does with them — and not every part of the API is supported everywhere.

| | [OpenFGA](./authorization-openfga.md) | [Cedar](./authorization-cedar.md)<span class="lkp"></span> | AllowAll |
|---|---|---|---|
| Grant and revoke | Yes | Planned for 0.14 | Recorded, never enforced |
| List a resource's grants | Yes | Planned for 0.14 | Yes |
| List everything one principal holds | No — `501` | Planned for 0.14 | Yes |
| Enforced | Yes | By policy, not by grants | **No** |

Cedar decides from policies you author and deploy, so it publishes no grantable privileges today and rejects writes. AllowAll records and lists grants faithfully while permitting every request regardless — use it for development, never to express a security posture.

Under OpenFGA a grant *is* the same relationship tuple the older `/management/v1/permissions/...` API writes, so the two are views of one set of permissions with nothing to migrate between them. Prefer this API for new scripts and integrations.

### Privilege names come from your authorizer

Which privileges exist, and what each one reaches, is defined by the authorizer — `select` under OpenFGA, `get_metadata` under AllowAll. Fetch the names rather than hardcoding them; a name the server does not know is rejected:

```http
GET /management/v1/grants/grantable-privileges
```

For what each name means and how far it reaches — whether `select` implies `describe`, whether a warehouse grant covers the tables inside it — see your authorizer's own page: [Grants in the OpenFGA model](./authorization-openfga.md#grants), or [Cedar](./authorization-cedar.md).

## Granting access

Grant and revoke in one request, against the resource you are granting on:

```http
POST /management/v1/warehouse/{warehouse_id}/grants
```

```json
{
  "writes": [
    { "privilege": "select", "principal": { "user": "oidc~alice" } }
  ]
}
```

Grant to a **role** rather than to individual users wherever you can — one grant plus role membership beats one grant per person.

Granting requires the authority to hand that privilege on, on that resource. Your authorizer decides who has it; under OpenFGA see [Grants](./authorization-openfga.md#grants).

!!! note "The instance-admin bypass does not apply to grant writes"
    Handing out permissions is not covered by the [instance-admin bypass](./instance-admins.md). Grant writes always go through the configured authorizer, which decides the outcome.

## Revoking access

Put the same entry under `deletes`:

```json
{
  "deletes": [
    { "privilege": "modify", "principal": { "role": "0198e0f4-3f6e-7c31-8c7d-9b7b8f2a1d44" } }
  ]
}
```

- **Applying is idempotent.** Granting twice creates one grant; revoking a grant nobody holds is not an error. The whole request lands atomically.
- Success is `204`: every entry now holds, and every revoked entry no longer does.
- At most **100 entries** per request, `writes` and `deletes` combined.
- Concurrent changes to the same resource's grants can answer `409`. The request applied nothing — retry it.

## Where you can grant

The same request shape works at every level:

| Resource | Path |
|---|---|
| Server | `/management/v1/server/grants` |
| Project | `/management/v1/project/grants` |
| Warehouse | `/management/v1/warehouse/{warehouse_id}/grants` |
| Namespace | `/management/v1/warehouse/{warehouse_id}/namespace/{namespace_id}/grants` |
| Table | `/management/v1/warehouse/{warehouse_id}/table/{table_id}/grants` |
| View | `/management/v1/warehouse/{warehouse_id}/view/{view_id}/grants` |
| Generic table | `/management/v1/warehouse/{warehouse_id}/generic-table/{generic_table_id}/grants` |
| Tag definition | `/management/v1/tag-definition/{tag_definition_id}/grants` |

`GET` on any of these lists the grants held there; `POST` applies a diff.

## Finding out what you may grant

`.../actions` does not report whether you may hand a privilege on — that is a separate right. Ask the resource:

```http
GET /management/v1/warehouse/{warehouse_id}/grants/grantable-privileges
```

Every privilege the level has is returned, each marked `allowed` for you. Add `principalUser` or `principalRole` to ask on someone else's behalf, which requires permission to read that resource's grants.

## Reviewing who has access

### On one resource

```http
GET /management/v1/warehouse/{warehouse_id}/grants
GET /management/v1/warehouse/{warehouse_id}/grants?principalUser=oidc~alice
```

Reading a resource's grants requires permission to read them there — with one exception.

### Your own access

Narrowing to **yourself** needs no such permission, only permission to see the resource. That lets a console show someone what they hold next to what they could ask for.

"Yourself" is the principal the request acts *as*. Belonging to a role does not make that role's grants yours. Under `X-Assume-Role` the request acts as that role, so narrowing to it is a self-read.

The server-level listing follows the same rule and is the only way to read your own server grants.

### Everything one principal holds in a project

```http
GET /management/v1/grants?principalUser=oidc~alice
GET /management/v1/grants?principalRole=<role_id>
```

Name exactly one of the two. To read every grant on a single resource, use that resource's own listing instead.

Asking about another principal requires the project's grant-read permission; asking about yourself is free. Server grants belong to no project and are excluded — use `GET /management/v1/server/grants`.

!!! warning "Not available under OpenFGA"
    OpenFGA stores permissions per object, so it cannot answer this without reading its whole store and returns `GrantListingNotImplemented` (501). Read one resource's grants from its own endpoint, or query OpenFGA directly. Deployments that keep grants in the catalog database answer it normally.

To answer "who can do what in this project", walk the resources you care about and read each one's grants. There is no whole-project export endpoint.

## What grants cannot do

Grants say what a principal *may* do. They cannot express deny rules, conditions such as time windows or IP ranges, or row filters and column masks. A listing also shows **direct** grants only — see [Direct grants are not effective permissions](./authorization.md#direct-grants-are-not-effective-permissions).

## Reference

**Lifecycle.**

- Creating a resource can grant the creator privileges on it, if the authorization backend says creation confers them.
- Deleting a resource revokes its grants with it. Under OpenFGA this covers the deleted resource itself but not everything inside a deleted warehouse — see [grants outlive the resources they name](./authorization-openfga.md#managing-grants-through-the-grants-api).
- Deleting a user revokes their grants, so a re-created user id never inherits access.
- Grants removed *with* their principal or resource are not audited individually: deleting a user emits one revocation record per grant, but deleting a role or a resource does not. The deletion of the role or resource is the audit record, and the grants on it are gone by definition. Only explicit revocations through the grants API produce per-grant records.
- Soft-deleted tables and views keep their grants until expiration, so an undrop restores the access that was there before. They stay visible on the resource's own listing and are left out of the project-scoped listing until the table is restored.
- Deactivating a warehouse hides its children's grants but not its own, so an administrator can still audit and revoke at the warehouse level.

**Privilege categories.** Each entry from `grantable-privileges` carries a `display-name`, a `description`, and a `category` for grouping a picker:

| Category | Contains |
|---|---|
| `metadata` | reading an object's definition, and attaching tags |
| `read` | reading data |
| `write` | changing an object and its contents |
| `create` | creating objects inside it |
| `security` | ownership and the right to hand privileges on |
| `administration` | the coarse built-in roles, such as `project_admin` |

**Auditing.** Grants are current state, not history: a listing tells you what access exists, never how it came to exist, and **no grantor is published**. Who granted a privilege is answered by the `grant_created` audit record, per grant — see [Logging](./logging.md#operational-audit-events). Deleting a resource removes its grants without emitting one; the resource's own deletion record is the trace.

**Switching authorizers means re-granting, not migrating.** A grant recorded under one authorizer confers nothing under another, because the privilege names belong to the authorizer.

**Under OpenFGA.** A grant is a relationship tuple, which produces a handful of behavioural differences — paging, principal validation, event emission. See [Managing grants through the grants API](./authorization-openfga.md#managing-grants-through-the-grants-api).

**API reference.** Every endpoint, parameter and error is in the [Management API reference](./api/management.md).
