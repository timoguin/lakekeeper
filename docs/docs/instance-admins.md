# Instance Admins

*Available since Lakekeeper 0.12.1.*

**Instance admins** are principals listed directly in Lakekeeper's static
configuration. They bypass the configured Authorizer for administrative
actions, so they can still manage the catalog when the Authorizer itself is
broken or misconfigured. The bypass applies once a request has authenticated
and resolved to a configured identity: it replaces the authorization decision,
not the rest of the request path.

The typical instance admin is an automation account: a Kubernetes Operator
reconciling Lakekeeper resources, for example, or an infrastructure admin
responsible for operating the deployment. Without this mechanism, common
failure modes would lock everyone out — for instance, deleting the last
OpenFGA admin tuple, or deploying a Cedar policy that denies everything.

## Scope

Instance admins bypass authorization for **control-plane** operations:

- Bootstrap.
- Project, role, warehouse, namespace management.
- Table / view metadata operations, including `GetMetadata`, `Commit`,
  `Drop`, `Rename`, property changes.
- User management.

Instance admins do **not** bypass authorization for:

- **Data-plane operations** — `CatalogTableAction::ReadData`,
  `CatalogTableAction::WriteData`, and `CatalogViewAction::Select` still
  route through the configured Authorizer. If the instance admin does not
  hold the relevant grants, reads and writes of table row data (and
  execution of views via the referenced-by chain) are denied. In the default
  OpenFGA model `Select` and `GetMetadata` resolve to the same underlying
  grant, so ordinary users see no behavioural change — the two exist as
  distinct actions so that the bypass carve-out can exclude `Select`.
- **Role assumption** (`x-assume-role` header) — an instance admin must act
  with their own identity. Assuming a role opts into that role's narrower
  scope.
- **Handing out permissions** — writes through the
  [`/management/v1/.../grants`](./grants.md) API under every Authorizer, and
  through the endpoints the active Authorizer exposes itself (for example
  `/management/v1/permissions/...` under OpenFGA; Cedar exposes its own set).
  These always go through the Authorizer's own grant-check path, so the outcome
  is the Authorizer's to decide rather than the static configuration's. Under
  OpenFGA an instance admin who holds no relations is refused, and
  `grants/grantable-privileges` reports them as able to grant nothing — that
  being the truth. Ongoing permission administration stays with a principal
  that holds real grants in the configured Authorizer.

    The carve-out covers grant *writes*, not every route to access. Role
    membership is a control-plane operation, so an instance admin can still
    place a principal into a role that already holds privileges.

    *Reading* permissions is not restricted. A grant listing is a control-plane
    read like any other, so an instance admin can audit who holds what. The
    split is deliberate: disclosure to an operator who can already read every
    other record is not an escalation, whereas writing a grant is.

This split keeps a leaked operator credential from being trivially used
either to exfiltrate data or to write itself the grants it does not hold.

## Configuration

Set `LAKEKEEPER__INSTANCE_ADMINS` to a **TOML inline array** of user IDs. For
simple string arrays this is syntactically identical to a JSON array:

```yaml
# e.g. in a Kubernetes deployment's env block
env:
  - name: LAKEKEEPER__INSTANCE_ADMINS
    value: '["kubernetes~eb952f26-3a1a-4020-bcb4-3f7d43049284","oidc~alice"]'
```

Each entry is a Lakekeeper user ID of the form `<idp_id>~<subject>`. The
`idp_id` matches the identifier of a configured Authenticator (for example,
`kubernetes` or `oidc`). The `subject` is the resolved subject claim — for
Kubernetes ServiceAccount tokens that is the service account's `uid` (as
returned by the `TokenReview` API, e.g.
`eb952f26-3a1a-4020-bcb4-3f7d43049284`); for OIDC it is whatever the
configured subject claim produces.

A bare string (e.g. `oidc~alice`) is **rejected** — even a single admin must
be wrapped in brackets: `["oidc~alice"]`. The indexed-variable pattern that
some other config systems accept (`LAKEKEEPER__INSTANCE_ADMINS__0=...`) is
**not** supported.

## Operational notes

- **Not a recovery mechanism.** If OpenFGA is unreachable or the authn layer
  is misconfigured such that the instance admin's identity cannot be
  resolved, the bypass does not engage. Instance admins are for day-to-day
  operator access, not break-glass recovery.
- **Rotation.** The admin list is read once at process startup. Adding or
  removing an admin requires a redeploy. This is intentional: the mechanism
  is a deployment-config concern, not a runtime one.
- **Audit.** Authorization events include a `privilege_source` field
  indicating how the decision was reached: `"internal"` (in-process call),
  `"instance_admin"` (config-granted bypass), or `"authorizer"`
  (configured Authorizer backend decision). See the
  [Logging guide](./logging.md#audit-logs-and-rust_log) for the event
  schema.
- **Role-assumed requests.** Setting `x-assume-role` on a request from an
  instance admin drops the bypass for that request — the effective scope is
  whatever the assumed role holds.
- **Permission administration.** Because instance admins cannot write
  grants or permission assignments, day-to-day management of them is done by
  a human (or service) principal that holds real grants in the configured
  Authorizer — under OpenFGA, one bootstrapped through it. The operator use
  case is provisioning (creating projects/warehouses, initial bootstrap), not
  ongoing user administration. A fresh deployment gets its first grant-holder
  without one: bootstrap makes the bootstrapping principal a server admin (or
  operator), and creating a project makes its creator that project's admin.
