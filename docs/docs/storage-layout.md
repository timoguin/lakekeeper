# Storage Layout

The storage layout controls how namespace and tabular directories are structured under the warehouse base location. It is configured via the `storage-layout` field inside the `storage-profile` when creating or updating a warehouse. The layout applies to new namespaces and to new tabulars in namespaces without a persisted `location`; a new tabular in a namespace with a `location` property is placed under that location (see [Namespace Location Property](#namespace-location-property)). Existing tabular locations are not changed.

## Layout Types

| Type                       | JSON `"type"` value            | Description    |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------|
| Default                    | `"default"`                    | Flat: no namespace directories; all tabulars are placed directly under the base location with a `{uuid}` segment. Used when `storage-layout` is omitted. **Changed in 0.13** — see [Default](#default). |
| Full hierarchy             | `"full-hierarchy"`             | One directory per namespace level in the full ancestry, one for the tabular. |
| Tabular-only (flat)          | `"tabular-only"`                 | No namespace directories; all tabulars are placed directly under the base location. |

!!! note "OneLake supports only the default layout"
    The [OneLake](storage-onelake.md) storage profile currently rejects `tabular-only` and `full-hierarchy` at warehouse-creation time because OneLake silently percent-decodes `%XX` in blob paths, which would alias `{name}` segments that differ only by URL-encoding. See [OneLake path and layout restrictions](storage-onelake.md#path-and-layout-restrictions) for details.

!!! warning "Some layouts prevent moving namespaces"
    A namespace's location is computed once when it is created and then frozen, so moving a namespace never relocates existing data. Under layouts that derive the location from the namespace hierarchy or from namespace *names*, a move would leave later-created child namespaces outside the moved namespace's location, fragmenting the layout. Lakekeeper therefore rejects the move with `StorageLayoutForbidsNamespaceMove` in those cases:

    | Layout | `namespace` template contains `{name}` | Rename | Re-parent |
    |--------|----------------------------------------|--------|-----------|
    | `default` / `tabular-only` | n/a — no namespace directories are emitted | allowed | allowed |
    | `full-hierarchy` | yes | **rejected** | **rejected** |
    | `full-hierarchy` | `{uuid}` only | allowed | **rejected** — the ancestor chain itself changes |

    The default layout emits no namespace directories, so this restriction only affects warehouses that explicitly configure `full-hierarchy`.

## Default

The default layout is **flat**: tabulars are placed directly under the warehouse base location with no namespace directories, using a `{uuid}` segment. This applies where Lakekeeper computes the location from the current layout; in a namespace with a persisted `location`, new tabulars use that location.

For a tabular `orders` in any namespace the path is:

```text
<base>/<orders-tabular>
```

With the default `{uuid}` template this looks like:

```text
s3://my-bucket/warehouse/<uuid-of-tabular>/
```

To use the default layout explicitly:

```json
{
  "storage-profile": {
    "type": "s3",
    "storage-layout": {
      "type": "default"
    }
  }
}
```

!!! warning "The default layout changed in 0.13"
    Before 0.13, the default layout emitted a directory for the **direct parent namespace** (`<base>/<parent-namespace-uuid>/<tabular-uuid>`). As of 0.13 the default is flat (`<base>/<tabular-uuid>`).

    The change is **not retroactive** — storage paths are assigned once, at creation time, and are never recomputed:

    - **Existing tabulars** keep their current locations.
    - **Existing namespaces** keep their persisted `location` property, so new tabulars created in them remain nested under the old `<parent-namespace-uuid>/` directory (see [Namespace Location Property](#namespace-location-property)).
    - Only **namespaces created on or after 0.13** use the flat default.

    A warehouse spanning the upgrade can therefore hold a mix of nested (pre-0.13 namespaces) and flat (new namespaces) tabular paths. If you want namespace directories in new tabular paths, set `storage-layout` to [`full-hierarchy`](#full-hierarchy) — note that this nests *every* ancestor level, whereas the pre-0.13 default nested only the direct parent.

## Full Hierarchy

The full hierarchy layout creates one path segment for **every namespace level** in the ancestry, followed by the tabular segment.

For a tabular `orders` in namespace `europe` / `production` the path is:

```text
<base>/<europe-namespace>/<production-namespace>/<orders-tabular>
```

With `{name}-{uuid}` templates:

```text
s3://my-bucket/warehouse/europe-<namespace-uuid>/production-<namespace-uuid>/orders-<tabular-uuid>/
```

Configuration:

```json
{
  "storage-profile": {
    "type": "s3",
    "storage-layout": {
      "type": "full-hierarchy",
      "namespace": "{name}-{uuid}",
      "tabular": "{name}-{uuid}"
    }
  }
}
```

## Tabular-Only (Flat)

The flat layout places all tabulars directly under the warehouse base location with no namespace directories.

For a tabular `orders` in any namespace the path is:

```text
<base>/<orders-tabular>
```

!!! note
    The `tabular` template **must** contain `{uuid}` in the flat layout. Without it, tabulars with the same name in different namespaces would map to the same storage path, causing data corruption.

Configuration:

```json
{
  "storage-profile": {
    "type": "s3",
    "storage-layout": {
      "type": "tabular-only",
      "tabular": "{name}-{uuid}"
    }
  }
}
```

## Template Placeholders

Namespace and tabular templates support two placeholders:

| Placeholder | Description                                                    |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `{uuid}`    | UUID of the namespace or tabular, inserted without any encoding. |
| `{name}`    | Name of the namespace or tabular, URL percent-encoded. For example, `my tabular` becomes `my%20tabular` and `中文` becomes `%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87`. |

Both placeholders can be combined with each other and with literal text, e.g. `{name}-{uuid}`. When `storage-layout` is omitted from the storage profile, the `default` layout is used.

!!! warning "Always include `{uuid}` in templates"
    **We strongly recommend including `{uuid}` in every namespace and tabular template.** Storage paths are assigned once at creation time and are never updated when a tabular or namespace is renamed. If a template relies solely on `{name}` and a tabular or namespace is later renamed and re-created with the same name, Lakekeeper will reject the creation because the path is already in use by the old (now-renamed) object. Because UUIDs are unique and stable for the lifetime of an object, using `{uuid}` (alone or combined with `{name}`) guarantees that each object always has a distinct, collision-free storage path. This is the reason Lakekeeper defaults to pure `{uuid}` templates.

## Namespace Location Property

Namespaces have a `location` property that determines where their tabulars are stored:

- **With location property**: New tabulars always use the namespace's persisted location, regardless of storage layout changes.
- **Without location property**: These namespaces compute locations from the current storage layout. Layout changes affect new tabular placement.
