# Configuration

Lakekeeper is configured via environment variables. Settings listed in this page are shared between all projects and warehouses. Previous to Lakekeeper Version `0.5.0` please prefix all environment variables with `ICEBERG_REST__` instead of `LAKEKEEPER__`.

For most deployments, we recommend to set at least the following variables: `LAKEKEEPER__PG_DATABASE_URL_READ`, `LAKEKEEPER__PG_DATABASE_URL_WRITE`, `LAKEKEEPER__PG_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.

## Routing and Base-URL

Some Lakekeeper endspoints return links pointing at Lakekeeper itself. By default, these links are generated using the `x-forwarded-for`, `x-forwarded-proto` and `x-forwarded-port` headers, if these are not present, the `host` header is used. If these heuristics are not working for you, you may set the `LAKEKEEPER_BASE_URI` environment variable to the base-URL where Lakekeeper is externally reachable. This may be necessary if Lakekeeper runs behind a reverse proxy or load balancer, and you cannot set the headers accordingly. In general, we recommend relying on the headers.

### General

| Variable                                         | Example                                | Description |
|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----|
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__BASE_URI`</nobr>              | <nobr>`https://example.com:8181`<nobr> | Optional base-URL where the catalog is externally reachable. Default: `None`. See [Routing and Base-URL](#routing-and-base-url). |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__ENABLE_DEFAULT_PROJECT`<nobr> | `true`                                 | If `true`, the NIL Project ID ("00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000") is used as a default if the user does not specify a project when connecting. This option is enabled by default, which we recommend for all single-project (single-tenant) setups. Default: `true`. |

| `LAKEKEEPER__LISTEN_PORT`                        | `8181`                                 | Port Lakekeeper listens on. Default: `8181` |
| `LAKEKEEPER__BIND_IP`                            | `0.0.0.0`, `::1`, `::`                 | IP Address Lakekeeper binds to. Default: `0.0.0.0` (listen to all incoming IPv4 packages) |
| `LAKEKEEPER__SECRET_BACKEND`                     | `postgres`                             | The secret backend to use. If `kv2` (Hashicorp KV Version 2) is chosen, you need to provide [additional parameters](#vault-kv-version-2) Default: `postgres`, one-of: [`postgres`, `kv2`] |
| `LAKEKEEPER__ALLOW_ORIGIN`                       | `*`                                    | A comma separated list of allowed origins for CORS. |


### Persistence Store

Currently Lakekeeper supports only Postgres as a persistence store. You may either provide connection strings using `PG_DATABASE_URL_READ` or use the `PG_*` environment variables. Connection strings take precedence:

| Variable                                               | Example                                               | Description |
|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----|

### Vault KV Version 2

Configuration parameters if a Vault KV version 2 (i.e. Hashicorp Vault) compatible storage is used as a backend. Currently, we only support the `userpass` authentication method. Configuration may be passed as single values like `LAKEKEEPER__KV2__URL=http://vault.local` or as a compound value:
`LAKEKEEPER__KV2='{url="http://localhost:1234", user="test", password="test", secret_mount="secret"}'`

| Variable                                     | Example               | Description |
|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------|
| `LAKEKEEPER__KV2__URL`                       | `https://vault.local` | URL of the KV2 backend |
| `LAKEKEEPER__KV2__USER`                      | `admin`               | Username to authenticate against the KV2 backend |
| `LAKEKEEPER__KV2__PASSWORD`                  | `password`            | Password to authenticate against the KV2 backend |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__KV2__SECRET_MOUNT`</nobr> | `kv/data/iceberg`     | Path to the secret mount in the KV2 backend |


### Task queues

Lakekeeper uses task queues internally to remove soft-deleted tabulars and purge tabular files. The following global configuration options are available:

| Variable                                  | Example                   | Description |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------|------|
| `LAKEKEEPER__QUEUE_CONFIG__MAX_RETRIES`   | 5                         | Number of retries before a task is considered failed  Default: 5 |
| `LAKEKEEPER__QUEUE_CONFIG__MAX_AGE`       | 3600                      | Amount of seconds before a task is considered stale and could be picked up by another worker. Default: 3600 |
| `LAKEKEEPER__QUEUE_CONFIG__POLL_INTERVAL` | 3600ms/30s/30(deprecated) | Interval between polling for new tasks. Default: 10s. Supported units: ms (milliseconds) and s (seconds), leaving the unit out is deprecated, it'll default to seconds but is due to be removed in a future release. |

### Nats

Lakekeeper can publish change events to Nats (Kafka is coming soon). The following configuration options are available:

| Variable                                   | Example                 | Description |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------|
| `LAKEKEEPER__NATS_ADDRESS`                 | `nats://localhost:4222` | The URL of the NATS server to connect to |
| `LAKEKEEPER__NATS_TOPIC`                   | `iceberg`               | The subject to publish events to |
| `LAKEKEEPER__NATS_USER`                    | `test-user`             | User to authenticate against nats, needs `LAKEKEEPER__NATS_PASSWORD` |
| `LAKEKEEPER__NATS_PASSWORD`                | `test-password`         | Password to authenticate against nats, needs `LAKEKEEPER__NATS_USER` |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__NATS_CREDS_FILE`</nobr> | `/path/to/file.creds`   | Path to a file containing nats credentials |
| `LAKEKEEPER__NATS_TOKEN`                   | `xyz`                   | Nats token to use for authentication |

### Kafka

Lakekeeper uses [rust-rdkafka](https://github.com/fede1024/rust-rdkafka) to enable publishing events to Kafka.

The following features of rust-rdkafka are enabled:

- tokio
- ztstd
- gssapi-vendored
- curl-static
- ssl-vendored
- libz-static

This means that all features of [librdkafka](https://github.com/confluentinc/librdkafka) are usable. All necessary dependencies are statically linked and cannot be disabled. If you want to use dynamic linking or disable a feature, you'll have to fork Lakekeeper and change the features accordingly. Please refer to the documentation of rust-rdkafka for details on how to enable dynamic linking or disable certain features.

To publish events to Kafka, set the following environment variables:

| Variable                        | Example                                                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LAKEKEEPER__KAFKA_TOPIC`       | `lakekeeper`                                                              | The topic to which events are published                                                                                                                                                 |
| `LAKEKEEPER__KAFKA_CONFIG`      | `{"bootstrap.servers"="host1:port,host2:port","security.protocol"="SSL"}` | [librdkafka Configuration](https://github.com/confluentinc/librdkafka/blob/master/CONFIGURATION.md) as "Dictionary". Note that you cannot use "JSON-Style-Syntax". Also see notes below |
| `LAKEKEEPER__KAFKA_CONFIG_FILE` | `/path/to/config_file`                                                    | [librdkafka Configuration](https://github.com/confluentinc/librdkafka/blob/master/CONFIGURATION.md) to be loaded from a file. Also see notes below                                      |

#### Notes

`LAKEKEEPER__KAFKA_CONFIG` and `LAKEKEEPER__KAFKA_CONFIG_FILE` are mutually exclusive and the values are not merged, if both variables are set. In case that both are set, `LAKEKEEPER__KAFKA_CONFIG` is used.

A `LAKEKEEPER__KAFKA_CONFIG_FILE` could look like this:

```
{
  "bootstrap.servers"="host1:port,host2:port",
  "security.protocol"="SASL_SSL",
  "sasl.mechanisms"="PLAIN",
}
```

Checking configuration parameters is deferred to `rdkafka`

### Logging Cloudevents

Cloudevents can also be logged, if you do not have Nats up and running. This feature can be enabled by setting
Cloudevents can also be logged, if you do not have Nats or Kafka up and running. This feature can be enabled by setting

`LAKEKEEPER__LOG_CLOUDEVENTS=true`

### Authentication

To prohibit unwanted access to data, we recommend to enable Authentication.

Authentication is enabled if:

* `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_PROVIDER_URI` is set OR
* `LAKEKEEPER__ENABLE_KUBERNETES_AUTHENTICATION` is set to true

External OpenID and Kubernetes Authentication can also be enabled together. If `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_PROVIDER_URI` is specified, Lakekeeper will  verify access tokens against this provider. The provider must provide the `.well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint and the openid-configuration needs to have `jwks_uri` and `issuer` defined. 

Typical values for `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_PROVIDER_URI` are:

* Keycloak: `https://keycloak.local/realms/{your-realm}`
* Entra-ID: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{your-tenant-id-here}/v2.0/`

Please check the [Authentication Guide](./authentication.md) for more details.

| Variable                                         | Example                                      | Description |
|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----|
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_PROVIDER_URI`</nobr>   | `https://keycloak.local/realms/{your-realm}` | OpenID Provider URL. |
| `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_AUDIENCE`                    | `the-client-id-of-my-app`                    | If set, the `aud` of the provided token must match the value provided. Multiple allowed audiences can be provided as a comma separated list. |
| `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_ADDITIONAL_ISSUERS`          | `https://sts.windows.net/<Tenant>/`          | A comma separated list of additional issuers to trust. The issuer defined in the `issuer` field of the `.well-known/openid-configuration` is always trusted. `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_ADDITIONAL_ISSUERS` has no effect if `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_PROVIDER_URI` is not set. |
| `LAKEKEEPER__ENABLE_KUBERNETES_AUTHENTICATION`   | true                                         | If true, kubernetes service accounts can authenticate to Lakekeeper. This option is compatible with `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_PROVIDER_URI` - multiple IdPs (OIDC and Kubernetes) can be enabled simultaneously. |
| `LAKEKEEPER__KUBERNETES_AUTHENTICATION_AUDIENCE` | `https://kubernetes.default.svc`             | Audiences that are expected in Kubernetes tokens. Only has an effect if `LAKEKEEPER__ENABLE_KUBERNETES_AUTHENTICATION` is true. |
| `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_SCOPE`                       | `lakekeeper`                                 | Specify a scope that must be present in provided tokens received from the openid provider. |
| `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_SUBJECT_CLAIM`               | `sub` or `oid`                               | Specify the field in the user's claims that is used to identify a User. By default Lakekeeper uses the `oid` field if present, otherwise the `sub` field is used. We strongly recommend setting this configuration explicitly in production deployments. Entra-ID users want to use the `oid` claim, users from all other IdPs most likely want to use the `sub` claim. |

### Authorization
Authorization is only effective if [Authentication](#authentication) is enabled. Authorization must not be enabled after Lakekeeper has been bootstrapped! Please create a new Lakekeeper instance, bootstrap it with authorization enabled, and migrate your tables.

| Variable                                      | Example                                                                    | Description |

If `openfga` is chosen, you need to provide [additional parameters](#authorization). The `allowall` backend disables authorization - authenticated users can access all endpoints. Default: `allowall`, one-of: [`openfga`, `allowall`] |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__OPENFGA__ENDPOINT`</nobr>  | `http://localhost:35081`                                                   | OpenFGA Endpoint (gRPC). |
| `LAKEKEEPER__OPENFGA__STORE_NAME`             | `lakekeeper`                                                               | The OpenFGA Store to use. Default: `lakekeeper` |
| `LAKEKEEPER__OPENFGA__API_KEY`                | `my-api-key`                                                               | The API Key used for [Pre-shared key authentication](https://openfga.dev/docs/getting-started/setup-openfga/configure-openfga#pre-shared-key-authentication) to OpenFGA. If `LAKEKEEPER__OPENFGA__CLIENT_ID` is set, the API Key is ignored. If neither API Key nor Client ID is specified, no authentication is used. |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__OPENFGA__CLIENT_ID`</nobr> | `12345`                                                                    | The Client ID to use for Authenticating if OpenFGA is secured via [OIDC](https://openfga.dev/docs/getting-started/setup-openfga/configure-openfga#oidc). |
| `LAKEKEEPER__OPENFGA__CLIENT_SECRET`          | `abcd`                                                                     | Client Secret for the Client ID. |
| `LAKEKEEPER__OPENFGA__TOKEN_ENDPOINT`         | `https://keycloak.example.com/realms/master/protocol/openid-connect/token` | Token Endpoint to use when exchanging client credentials for an access token for OpenFGA. Required if Client ID is set |
| `LAKEKEEPER_TEST__OPENFGA__SCOPE`             | `openfga`                                                                  | Additional scopes to request in the Client Credential flow. |


### UI

When using the built-in UI which is hosted as part of the Lakekeeper binary, most values are pre-set with the corresponding values of Lakekeeper itself. Customization is typically required if Authentication is enabled. Please check the [Authentication guide](./authentication.md) for more information.

| Variable                                           | Example                                      | Description |
|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----|
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__UI__OPENID_PROVIDER_URI`</nobr> | `https://keycloak.local/realms/{your-realm}` | OpenID provider URI used for login in the UI. Defaults to `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_PROVIDER_URI`. Set this only if the IdP is reachable under a different URI from the users browser and lakekeeper. |
| `LAKEKEEPER__UI__OPENID_CLIENT_ID`                 | `lakekeeper-ui`                              | Client ID to use for the Authorization Code Flow of the UI. Required if Authentication is enabled. Defaults to `lakekeeper` |
| `LAKEKEEPER__UI__OPENID_REDIRECT_PATH`             | `/callback`                                  | Path where the UI receives the callback including the tokens from the users browser. Defaults to: `/callback` |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__UI__OPENID_SCOPE`</nobr>        | `openid email`                               | Scopes to request from the IdP. Defaults to `openid profile email`. |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__UI__OPENID_RESOURCE`</nobr>     | `lakekeeper-api`                             | Resources to request from the IdP. If not specified, the `resource` field is omitted (default). |

### SSL Dependencies

You may be running Lakekeeper in your own environment which uses self-signed certificates for e.g. Minio. Lakekeeper is built with reqwest's `rustls-tls-native-roots` feature activated, this means `SSL_CERT_FILE` and `SSL_CERT_DIR` environment variables are respected. If both are not set, the system's default CA store is used. If you want to use a custom CA store, set `SSL_CERT_FILE` to the path of the CA file or `SSL_CERT_DIR` to the path of the CA directory. The certificate used by the server cannot be a CA. It needs to be an end entity certificate, else you may run into `CaUsedAsEndEntity` errors.
